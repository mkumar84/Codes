## Intro Questions

- Who has used Kiva? 
- Why did you choose Kiva? 
- How did you choose the borrower? 
- What was your experience like? 
- Did you continue to lend to Kiva, and why or why not?


## Case Discussion Questions

_1. What is Kiva's value proposition?_

Kiva provides a connection between loan seekers with lenders.


_4. What factors might go into a lender's decision to lend money to a borrower?_

Answers will vary. Here is a previous class's answer:

- Loan amount
- Country
- Purpose
- Repayment history
- Backed by partner or not
- Feeling good about life in general


_5. How does text data affect a prediction model's ability to predict a default?_

It increases the accuracy and all the other metrics.


_7. According to the decision tree models, which variables best predict a default?_

- `nonpayment`. If "partner", then the loan very likely to be paid.
- `Topic 8`. If present, then more likely to be paid. Topic is "children, esperanza, support, women".- 
- `Topic 12`. If present, then more likely to be paid. Topic is "rice, farmers, baba, sector."
- `country`. Kenya is most likely to default.
- `loan_amount`. Large loan are more likely to be paid.

_7. What other text analytics/NLP techniques might be applied to the dataset to improve the prediction model?_

- More cleaning: stemming, fixing mispelling
- Translating all to English
- Using n-grams/phrases
- Using word2vec representations
- Extracting some structured data: 
  - How many kids
  - The name
  - Whether they have a job
  - The name of the field partner
  - Age

_8. What additional information might lead to a better predictive model?_

Ideas from previous classes:
- Loan history
- separate models per country
- translating all to english
- extracting age from text
- extract number of children from text.
- More data


_9. How should Kiva operationalize the prediction model? What technical challenges and risks do you envision? What procedural challenges and risks do you envision?_

One way to deploy the model is to publish the prediction next to each loan request.

Some technical challenges:

- The model must perform the predition in a timely manner. 
- There must be sufficient integration between the model and the webpage. 
- The model must be constantly updated to remain current.

Some procedural challenges:

- Borrowers might figure out the model (i.e., which words/phrases will predict a default), and change their stories accordingly, reducing the effectivenes of the model.

- Overall lending might decrease, since anyone predicted to be risky would stop getting loans. 

- On the other hand, overall lending might increase, as lenders might be willing to lend more money to borrowers who have a positive prediction.

- Overall lending might be more concentrated than it ought to be.

Some other deployment ideas:

- Another option is to use the risk factor to not allow the borrower to post the request if the model predicts below a certain threshold. 

- Another option still is to just show the predicted value to Kiva employees, who could (e.g.) use it to write a blog, report, or white paper that potential lenders could read.
